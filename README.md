This repository is for CSE492 Graduation Proejct about Multi-Model Evaluation of different BlackJack strategies.

# Abstract

The project aims to explore and compare the performance of multiple Blackjack-playing models, each employing distinct strategies or techniques while also incorporating user interaction for manual gameplay. Manual gameplay allows user to join and interact with models by playing next to them. The models encompass brute force enumeration, basic strategy chart adherence, historical data analysis, reinforcement learning-based decision- making, and card counting. The project assesses the effectiveness of each model in terms of win rate, average return, risk management, time efficiency, adaptability through extensive simulations and evaluations. Findings provide weaknesses and strengths of different playing methods.
