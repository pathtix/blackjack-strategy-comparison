# Multi-Model Evaluation of Blackjack Strategies

This repository is for CSE492 Graduation Proejct about Multi-Model Evaluation of different blackjack strategies.

# Abstract

The project aims to explore and compare the performance of multiple Blackjack-playing models, each employing distinct strategies. These models include brute force, basic strategy chart with/without card counting, Historical Data analysis, reinforcement learning-based decision-making. The project evaluates the effectiveness of each model in terms of win rate, average return, risk management, and adaptability through extensive simulations and evaluations. The findings will highlight the strengths and weaknesses of each playing method, providing valuable insights into the efficacy of different Blackjack strategies.
